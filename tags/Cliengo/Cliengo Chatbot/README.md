This template should be used to load a Cliengo Chatbot on your site. 

Its quite easy to setup: You just need your Cliengo CompanyID and WebsiteID.
Those paramters can be obtained from your Cliengo Dashboard following these steps:

1. Once logged in, go to the 'Chatbot' section.
2. There click on 'Installation' on the left side menu.
3. At the bottom there is a token section for installing. It has 2 values. The first one is the Company ID, and the second one the Website ID.

One you got both, proceed to place each one on the tag setup.

And thats it!

In case you dont find those values, you can always write to hello@cliengo.com and their support team will gladly assist you.
